### Intro to AngularJS - Live coding

You'll need to install and run an http-server like the following: https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server

After installing the server, navigate to the root directory and run: `http-server`

Your app should be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8080` by default

#### Some ideas for further functionality:
- Split the To Do List into separate pages for `/#/completed` and `/#/pending`
- Move out the Angular code into separate files
- Add styling, `http://mgcrea.github.io/angular-strap/` for example
- Add a `due_date` field with a datepicker
